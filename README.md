## Deployment

Deployments are, at this stage, supposed to run on a local machine, but in the future it might be possible to also run
it on CI.

### Deploy updates to the whole stack

This script should be run when changes that affect the whole stack have been made â€“Â e.g changes in `serverless.yml`:

```sh
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:production
```

### Deploy updates to function only

This script should be run when only source code has changed.

```sh
npm run deploy:fn:staging
npm run deploy:fn:production
```
